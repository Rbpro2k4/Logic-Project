# Sequence Detector Project

**Team Name**: Limitless Crew

**Team Members**:
- Charbel Abi Saad
- Hassan Hamdan
- Chiara Bassil
- Zayd El Hajj

This repository contains the implementation of a **Sequence Detector** designed as part of the Logic Lab (COE 322) course. The project includes various block diagrams and schematic files created using Quartus software.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

### Key Files
- **`SequenceDetector.qws`**: The Quartus workspace file that organizes the project structure.
- **Block Diagram Files**:
  - `Led1.bdf`, `Led2.bdf`, `Led3.bdf`, `Led4.bdf`: Block diagrams for LED control.
  - `7segment.bdf`: Block diagram for the 7-segment display.
  - `Treset.bdf`: Block diagram for the reset logic.
  - `Flags.bdf`: Block diagram for flag management.
  - `Decoder.bdf`: Block diagram for decoding logic.
  - `A.bdf`, `B.bdf`, `C.bdf`: Block diagrams for specific components.

### Reports
- **`SequenceDetector.map.rpt`**: A detailed report mapping the block diagrams and their usage in the project.

## Tools Used
- **Quartus**: The project was developed using Quartus software (version 9.1sp2).

## How to Open the Project
1. Open Quartus software.
2. Load the workspace file `SequenceDetector.qws`.
3. Navigate through the block diagrams and schematic files to explore the project.

## Features
- **LED Control**: Implements logic for controlling multiple LEDs.
- **7-Segment Display**: Includes a block diagram for driving a 7-segment display.
- **Reset Logic**: Provides a reset mechanism for the sequence detector.
- **Decoder**: Implements decoding logic for the sequence detection process.
- **Flags**: Manages flags for various states in the sequence detection.

## Usage
1. Open the project in Quartus.
2. Compile the project to generate the necessary outputs.
3. Simulate or deploy the design on supported hardware.
4. Use the provided executable (`.exe`) to check the simulation of the breadboard.
